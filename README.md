## Description
This project utilizes JavaScript and MongoDB to create an API from scratch that allows users to create an account, post thoughts, reactions, and keep track of friend lists! This challenge is used as a demo of the backend happenings of a social media website and meant to display an understanding of API endpoints and incorporating NoSQL into a JS project.


## Instructions

Within your CLI, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm i; npm run build; npm run seed; npm start 
```

First you're installing the dependencies needed for this project, then you're compiling your TypeScript files into JavaScript. 
Next you'll be seeding the project with provided sample data. Finally running the start command to test the finished result.
